# What is Price?

**Price is a permissionless and reliable oracle solution that leverages Uniswap V3 and automation to provide safe price quotes on any existing token.**

Price is built on top of Uniswap V3, thus inheriting all its decentralization and sustainability but solving its main problems:

- **Trust issues**: We make liquidity a trustworthy and predictable asset for the oracle's users.

- **Complexity**: Neither the protocol nor the user need to handle anything. Contracts will manage positions, fees, pool parameters, and security.

- **Multi-block attack**: We use automation to detect and correct price manipulations, including multi-block attacks. This correction will unlock the use of safe and precise price data.
